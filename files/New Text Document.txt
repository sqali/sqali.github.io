1. *SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):* A structured process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. Planning, Requirements analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.

2. *STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle):* The process of testing software to ensure its quality and reliability throughout the software development life cycle.

3. *Defect Life Cycle:* Describes the stages a defect goes through, from identification to resolution, typically including phases like New, Open, Fixed, Retest, and Closed.

4. *HP ALM (Application Lifecycle Management):* A tool used for managing the application lifecycle, including requirements, tests, and defects.

5. *Attributes and Components of Test Plan and Test Cases:* Test plans include objectives, scope, resources, schedule, and deliverables. Test cases consist of test steps, expected results, and test data.

6. *Agile Methodology:* An iterative and flexible approach to software development, emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback.

7. *Waterfall Model:* A sequential software development model where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through phases like requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

10. *Traceability Matrix:* A document linking requirements to test cases, ensuring test coverage and traceability throughout the development process.

11. *Testing Requirement Documents:* Documents specifying the testing requirements, including test objectives, test scope, resources, and schedule.

12. *Entry-Exit Criteria:* Criteria that define when a testing phase can begin (entry) and when it should end (exit), ensuring that testing is effective and efficient.


Test Strategy:

Scope: The test strategy outlines the high-level approach and guidelines for testing the software application. It provides an framework that guides the entire testing process. including the testing objectives, methodologies, tools, resources, and timelines.

Test Plan:

Scope: The test plan is a detailed document that outlines the specifics of the testing activities to be conducted for a particular project or release. It provides a comprehensive roadmap for executing the testing effort. The test plan contains detailed information about the testing activities, including specific test cases, test data, test environments, test scripts, and acceptance criteria.
