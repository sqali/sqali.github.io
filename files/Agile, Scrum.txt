1) **Describe the Agile Methodology**:

Agile methodology is a software development approach that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback. It values flexibility and adaptability to change throughout the development process.

2) **What is a Sprint?**:

A sprint is a time-boxed iteration within the Agile development framework during which specific work is completed by the cross functional team aiming to produce a potentially shippable increment of product functionality by working on specifi user stories and tasks and made ready for review.

3) **What will be done in Daily Scrum?**:

In the Daily Scrum, also known as the Daily Standup, team members gather to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day. Each team member answers three questions:

- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Are there any obstacles or impediments blocking my progress?

The Daily Scrum is a brief meeting, usually lasting around 15 minutes, and serves to keep the team aligned, identify and address issues quickly, and maintain momentum throughout the sprint.

4) **What is a Retrospective Sprint?**:

A retrospective sprint, also known as a Sprint Retrospective, is a meeting held at the end of each sprint in Agile development. Its purpose is to reflect on the recent sprint and identify areas for improvement in processes, tools, and teamwork. The team discusses what went well, what didn't go well, and what actions can be taken to enhance performance and productivity in future sprints.

5) **How many days of sprint?**:

The duration of a sprint can vary depending on the project's needs and the preferences of the Agile team. While two weeks is a common duration for sprints, some teams may opt for shorter or longer sprints based on factors like project complexity, team capacity, and the organization's Agile maturity. Sprints typically range from one to four weeks in length.
