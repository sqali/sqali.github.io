### CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This is my complete implementation of assignments and projects in [***CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition***](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) by Stanford (Spring, 2019). NumPy implementations of forward and backward pass of each layer in a convolutional neural network have given me a deep understanding of how state-of-the-art Computer Vision architectures work under the hood. In addition, I explored the inner beauty of Deep Learning by implementing Style Transfer, Deep Dream, Texture Systhesis in PyTorch and generating new images with GANs.

### Credit Risk Prediction Web App

[![Open Web App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Heroku-Open_Web_App-blue?logo=Heroku)](http://credit-risk.herokuapp.com/)
[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/sqali/credit-risk-prediction/blob/master/documents/Notebook.ipynb)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sqali/credit-risk-prediction)

After my team preprocessed a dataset of 10K credit applications and built machine learning models to predict credit default risk, I built an interactive user interface with Streamlit and hosted the web app on Heroku server.

### Kaggle Competition: Predict Ames House Price using Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and LightGBM

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://sqali.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/ames-house-price.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sqali/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking **95/15502**, approximately **top 0.6%** in the Kaggle leaderboard.

### Document classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sqali/Applied-AI-Assignments/tree/main/Document%20Classification%20Using%20CNN)

This project entails the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of document classification. I worked with a dataset of text documents, utilizing the filenames for class label extraction. The challenge involves preprocessing the text data, designing and training a CNN model for classification, and evaluating its performance on this multi-class text categorization task.

## ðŸŽµ Automatic Speech Recognition
### Spoken Digit Recognition using LSTM

The project revolves around Spoken Digit Recognition. The task involves reading and preprocessing a dataset of speech signals, with the goal of predicting the spoken digit. The project requires the use of LSTM networks for training both raw data and spectrogram-converted data. An additional task is to create augmented data and repeat the training process. The work should follow the provided instructions and graders, and return outputs in the specified formats.
