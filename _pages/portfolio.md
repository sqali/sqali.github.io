## ü§ñ Computer Vision
### Document classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sqali/Applied-AI-Assignments/tree/main/Document%20Classification%20Using%20CNN)

This project entails the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of document classification. I worked with a dataset of text documents, utilizing the filenames for class label extraction. The challenge involves preprocessing the text data, designing and training a CNN model for classification, and evaluating its performance on this multi-class text categorization task.

The project revolves around Spoken Digit Recognition. The task involves reading and preprocessing a dataset of speech signals, with the goal of predicting the spoken digit. The project requires the use of LSTM networks for training both raw data and spectrogram-converted data. An additional task is to create augmented data and repeat the training process. The work should follow the provided instructions and graders, and return outputs in the specified formats.

An innovative fusion of AI and computer vision, this assistant acts as a personal trainer for gym-goers. It monitors exercise routines in real-time, providing immediate feedback on form and posture. Using advanced tracking algorithms, it evaluates fitness progress, tailors workout recommendations, and ensures users get the most from their gym sessions.

## üéµü§ñ Music Generation
### AI-driven creation of original musical compositions and melodies

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sqali/music-generation)

Harnessing the power of neural networks, this project delves into the creation of original music compositions. Deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, are trained on vast music datasets, learning intricate patterns, rhythms, and harmonies. As the models generate new sequences, they emulate the styles of learned compositions, producing novel yet harmoniously structured tunes. The result is an AI maestro, capable of crafting melodies and orchestrating symphonies that resonate with human emotions.
