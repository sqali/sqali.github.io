## Career Objectives
My name is Sayed Qaiser Ali. I am a Machine Learning Engineer with industry experiences in Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision. I am currently a **Computer Vision Intern** at **Etsy**, where I develop Deep Learning frameworks to improve personalization and image-based recommendations. Besides that, I works as a part-time **Machine Learning Researcher** at **Skim AI Technologies**, where I apply latest research in Deep Learning NLP to make machines understand human languages better. Projects I worked on include Named Entity Recognition (NER), Document Classification, large-scale Sentiment Analysis and Summarization.

I am pursuing a STEM master's degree at the **University of Rochester**, where I receive solid training in Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. I am proficient in Python and R programming languages, data retrieval and processing with SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data. I have completed Data Science projects and Kaggle competitions, where I built, tuned and ensembled machine learning models including Regresisons (Ridge, Lasso), Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost and LightGBM. I am very proficient at using PyTorch to build and deploy cutting-egde AI systems to solve NLP and CV problems. More details about these projects can be found below:

I love to read AI blogs, watch YouTube tutorials and listen to AI podcasts. I am learning so much from the AI community, where knowledge is shared to challenge the boundary of computer intelligence. In addition, as an NLP researcher, I frequently publish articles to discuss recent research papers in Deep Learning and open-source projects to apply state-of-the-art technologies in NLP such as BERT and ELECTRA.
